      "text": "The [[$CorePackages]] tiddler contains a DataList of packages to import when TWiki first loads.\n\nCore Packages are a select few packages which form the base of twiki i.e. necessary functionality.\nThese should be distinguished from [[$ExtensionPackages]] which provided additional functionality.\n\n## What is a Package?\n\nA package, at it's most basic is just a URL which returns a list of tiddlers. Technically a package is an object with at least one property `tiddlers` of type Array.\n\nThese tiddlers:\n* may contain functionality or data\n* once loaded, all code tiddlers are executed\n* can encapsulate things like themes or plugins\n* may or may not be stored depending on flags applied when importing them\n\n## Import Flags\nIn addition to URLs you can specify options as to how tiddlers are auto-imported:\n\n* `save`: Set the `save` flag to ensure imported tiddlers are stored locally when you save. The default is off so imported tiddlers are nor persisted. By default the `core` and `icons` packages are set to `save` so that you have basic functionality offline\n* `force`: Set the `overwrite` flag to ensure the entire package is always imported even if this means overwriting tiddlers you may have changed. The default is off which means the auto-importer will prompt you about overwriting tiddlers you may have changed.\n* `nooverwrite`: Set the `nooverwrite` flag if you plan to change imported tiddlers and don't want them overwritten. The auto-importer will just skip importing them if the tiddler exists\n\n## Road Map\nCurrently Packages are just URLs, later we will introduce the concept of Repos which store a list of uniquely named packages and their URLs.\nAt that time we can simply refer to packages by their unique name (e.g. `core` or `backup-plugin`).\n\n- In future a package will contain more metadata e.g. name, version, author etc.\n- You will also be able to define update policies for packages e.g. if you want automatic updating of core patches or minor updates to extensions\n\n\n",
